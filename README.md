I have worked in an embedded system domain for ten years. I am primarily prototyping **Electronic applications** for Automation, Monitoring and Signal Processing. I also make **UI/UX Designs** and **Frontend-Dev** for Embedded Applications, Web Apps, Websites, TV Apps, Mobile Apps, and as well as Graphic Designs to create materials for marketing and user interface.
